            **Thanks for your contribution!**
            The approval and merge process is almost fully automated 🧙
            Here's how it works:
            1. You open a new pull request
            2. Automated tests check the code
            3. Maintainers review the code
            4. Once approved, the PR is ready to merge.

            > 👉 **Omit the extended description**
            > Please remove the commit body before merging the pull request.
            > Instead, include the pull request number in the title to provide the full context
            > about the change.

            ☝️ Lastly, the title for the commit will come from the pull request title. So please provide a descriptive title that summarizes the changes in **50 characters or less using the imperative mood.**
            Happy coding! 🎉
