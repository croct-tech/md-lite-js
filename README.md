## Introduction

This library provides a fast and simple Markdown parser with zero dependencies.
Perfect for those who need to handle basic Markdown syntax like **bold**, *italic*, and [links](#) without the overhead of a full-featured Markdown parser.

**Features**

- 🪶 **Lightweight:**  Zero dependencies and less than 2KB gzipped.
- 🌐 **Cross-environment:**  Works in Node.js and browsers.
- ✍️ **Minimalist:** Supports only _italic_, **bold**, ~~strikethrough~~, `inline code`, [links](https://croct.com), <img src="https://github.com/croct-tech/md-lite-js/assets/943036/6e6a2411-67d2-4f7b-89d8-bc08fd73c662" alt="image" width="16" height="16" /> images, and ¶ paragraphs.
- 🛠 **Flexible:** Render whatever you want, from HTML to JSX.

### Who is this library for?

If you're working on a project that requires rendering Markdown for short texts like titles, subtitles, and descriptions, but you don't need a full-featured Markdown parser, this library is for you.

## Installation

We recommend using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) to install the package:

```sh
npm install @croct/md-lite
```

Alternatively, you can use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```sh
yarn add @croct/md-lite
```

## Basic usage

After installation, you can import and use the `parse` and `render` functions in your project. 

### Parsing Markdown

To parse a Markdown string into an AST, use the `parse` function:

```ts
import {parse} from '@croct/md-lite';

const markdown = '**Hello**, [World](https://example.com)';

const ast = parse(markdown);
```

The `parse` function returns a tree-like structure called an [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree) (AST).
You can find the full AST definition [here](/src/ast.ts).

### Rendering Markdown

To render an AST into whatever you want, use the `render` function.
It accepts either an AST generated by the `parse` function or a string as input:

```ts
import {render} from '@croct/md-lite';

const markdown = '**Hello**, [World](https://example.com)';

const html = render(ast, {
    fragment: node => node.children.join(''),
    text: node => node.content,
    bold: node => `<b>${node.children}</b>`,
    italic: node => `<i>${node.children}</i>`,
    strike: node => `<s>${node.children}</s>`,
    code: node => `<code>${node.content}</code>`,
    image: node => `<img src="${node.src}" alt="${node.alt}">`,
    link: node => `<a href="${node.href}">${node.children}</a>`,
    paragraph: node => `<p>${node.children.join('')}</p>`,
});
```

Here is an example of how to render the Markdown string above into JSX:

```tsx
import {render} from '@croct/md-lite';

const markdown = '**Hello**, [World](https://example.com)';

const jsx = render(ast, {
    fragment: node => node.children,
    text: node => node.content,
    bold: node => <b>{node.children}</b>,
    italic: node => <i>{node.children}</i>,
    strike: node => <s>{node.children}</s>,
    code: node => <code>{node.content}</code>,
    image: node => <img src={node.src} alt={node.alt} />,
    link: node => <a href={node.href}>{node.children}</a>,
    paragraph: node => <p>{node.children}</p>,
});
```
